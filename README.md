# HELMDEEP

HelmDeep built on top of Helm command line to keep life simplier.

Main features for now includes:
- Local repo package that do not require to run an actual server to use.
- Some utility commands to help create and use templates.
- Reorganize the command in the way I prefer it to be.
- Package everything in a docker to simplify install process.
- Helper command to connect to K8S and some command autocomplete
